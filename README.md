# phishing-email-analysis
A complete data science project to analyze and predict phishing emails using Python, pandas, and various machine learning models. This project includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model building, and evaluation to classify emails as phishing or legitimate.
# Phishing Email Analysis and Prediction

This is a comprehensive data science project aimed at detecting phishing emails using machine learning techniques. The project involves analyzing a dataset of emails to classify them as either legitimate or phishing.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Load and clean the email dataset
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify key features that distinguish phishing emails
- Apply machine learning models for prediction
- Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is `Phishing_Email.csv`, which contains features extracted from email data that help in identifying whether an email is phishing or not.

## ✅ Results

The project successfully builds models that can classify emails with a high degree of accuracy. This can be useful in real-world email filtering systems to prevent phishing attacks.
